When entering the bar from the !aura directory, enter 4. This will default to the Starfinder usuals of bar 1 (green) being SP and 2 (blue) being HP for PC tokens and bar 1 being HP for non-PC tokens. For PC tokens, it will use SP+HP to calculate the character health/death, while for non-PC tokens it will use only bar 1.

Note that drones, summoned creatures, and starships (those which are assigned to a PC) count as PC tokens.
